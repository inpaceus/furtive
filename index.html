      <h3>A purely build-centric server</h3>

      <p class="h4">
        Have you ever wanted a server in which you could merely build, without disturbances, or ulterior motives?
        We strive to be that very server––thus we provide features by-and-for Minecraft builders.

        What makes us unique is in the everlasting promotion of classical architecture, citybuilding, and liturgical design.
        As such, courses on these topics are available––well-written––here.
