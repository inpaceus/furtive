      As a building server, the top priority is to preserve people's creations. Our rules are designed to be minimal but cover the basics of simple respect and ethicality for our members.

      <h4>Be a good person.</h4>
      <p class="h4">
       Don't deliberately attempt to harm or attack other members, or the actual server.
       Generally, you should mind the business of other people and not "be in the way," if you will.

       If an admin directs you to do something, they have a reason, and you should listen to them.
       Administrators actively interpret what is right and wrong.
       Respect them as you'd respect another member.
